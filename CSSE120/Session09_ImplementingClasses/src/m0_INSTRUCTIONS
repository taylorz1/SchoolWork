Students:

Here is how you do today's exercise, in m1_Point.

Do TODO 1 as usual, then TODO 2.  It tells you to:
  -- With your instructor, understand these instructions.
  -- In m1_Point, write a two-line implementation of a Point
       class that (at that point) has NO methods.

Then, for each TODO from #3 to the end of the exercise, you will
do the following: (This shows TODO 6 (MOVE_TO) as an example.
Each other TODO is the same, but for the method of that TODO.)

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # TODO: 6.
    #   a. Read the above description of the   MOVE_TO   method.
    #        Do NOT proceed until you understand WHAT it should do
    #        (but not necessary HOW it will do it).
    #        NO CODE YET.  Ask questions as needed.
    #   b. Figure out what TEST(S) would TEST the   move_to   method.
    #        Implement (i.e., write the code for) those tests.
    #        You will see red marks and cannot RUN those tests because
    #        you have not (yet) implemented the   move_to   method.
    #        COMMIT YOUR WORK and also ask questions as needed.
    #   c. Implement and test the  move_to   method.
    #        Get someone knowledgeable to confirm that your
    #        implementation AND tests are correct.  COMMIT YOUR WORK.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 We may code the first few TODO's together.
