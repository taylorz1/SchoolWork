We have implemented the following features:


General Heirarchy(class order, class existance, etc) :: 1 hour.
World Drawing(Draws a world successfully) :: 2 hour.
Class hero exist :: 1 hour
Other classes exist :: 1 hour


Def should've start earlier. Will complete before Milestone 2. Underestimated the time
it would take to assemble the general mainframe stuff.
