WHAT WE DID:
We've made a shell which can print a file and run a program. It uses interrupt
21h to talk to the loaded kernel and use the system functions (reading a file,
reading a string, printing text, running a program). The shell is not built in
to the kernel, and the only thing the kernel actually does is launch the shell.
The kernel is also broken up into logical files that separate the main working
parts of the kernel (floppy_driver deals with files, prog deals with loading and
killing programs, etc.)

HOW TO VERIFY:
Boot the system using `make test-bochs` (or however you want to start the VM)
and then type the commands `type messag` and then `execute tstpr2` to see that
all functionality described in the Milestone works as expected.
