WHAT WE DID:
We've implemented a bunch of special features like graphics that can be
run by browsing the output of the help prompt. The features that we implemented
in this milestone according to the specifications, such as loading
and terminating programs according to a scheduler. We created a process table
that operates by timer interrupt.

HOW TO VERIFY:
Boot the system using make test or make test-bochs and then type the following
commands 'Kill xxxx' or 'phello' or 'execute grphcs' or 'execforeground' or
'shellcolor N' or 'cls' clear screen.
