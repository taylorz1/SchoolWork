WHAT WE DID:
We've implemented a bunch of special features like graphics that can be
run by browsing the output of the help prompt. The features that we implemented
in this milestone according to the specifications, such as loading
and terminating programs according to a scheduler. We created a process table
that operates by timer interrupt.

HOW TO VERIFY:
Boot the system using make test or make test-bochs and then type the following
commands 'Kill xxxx' or 'phello' or 'execute grphcs' or 'execforeground' or
'shellcolor N' or 'cls' clear screen.


HOW TO USE:
To build the operating system, simply type 'make test' into your console.
For any feature you wish to test simply write 'help' to see the total
documentation.

BUGS:
If you type kill with no arguemnt after running exec phello it kills the shell.
It you write 'type KERNEL' it will print a bunch of random memory.

EXTRA FEATURES:
shellcolor, jumphng, shutdown, graphics library, sitstill, several math
functions.
