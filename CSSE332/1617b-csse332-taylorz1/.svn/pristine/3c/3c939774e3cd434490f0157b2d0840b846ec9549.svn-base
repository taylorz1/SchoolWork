a) If the number of kernel threads allocated to the program is less than
the number of cores available than this implies that some cores are idle
increaing dead time of cores. Decreasing efficiency.

b) If the number of threads allocated is equal than that implies that all
cores are in use and this system is running at peak efficiency.

c) There are some idle kernel threads, due to no attached user thread.
The thread handler has to handle all the threads on the processor which
unideally means that the processor could be using a kernel thread with no
attached user process and that some user processes are idle.
