/* ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
 * PROGRAM  server.c                                              
 * The main function serves as the server that creates a shared      
 * memory of four integers, attaches the shared memory to its own    
 * address space, fills it with the numbers from command line, forks 
 * a client, waits until its client completes, detaches the shared   
 * memory, removes the shared memory, and finally exits.             
 *								     
 * The client process is overlaid with the image of another process  
 * that uses the common key to get the shared memory region. It then  
 * attaches the shared memory space to its own address space, 
 * accesses values in the space, and modifies the values as needed.
 * The parent process (server) and a child process (client) can thus 
 * communicate with each other using the shared memory space.        
 *								     
 * For this program to run successfully, an executible called "client"
 * must exist in the same directory as this program.
