SAMPLE OUTPUTS


./airlinereservation 3 output1.txt
./airlinereservation 5 output2.txt
./airlinereservation 15 output3.txt

output1.txt prints receipts as expected. Three customers, each with the seats they want.
There are no first class seats in this run.

output2.txt prints receipts as expected. This one has some first class seats selected.

output3.txt prints receipts as expected. There was one time that the program hung when there
were no more seats that could be assigned, but that didn't happen ever again, even when a
specific cabin was full. I guess you could say that was an anomoly.
