1. This is done pretty well with the separation of work between the client
and server. He also talks a lot about how you can write X11 extensions to 
do things like the ubunutu 3d desktop, etc.
2. This is also correct, there is no reliance on what the object actually is
as long as it is the right 'kind' of object (that is a server or client).
3. This is fine as far as X11 goes.
4. The design is pretty coupled via all the round trips required. He said
this is one of the biggest problems with X and that it is reduced in X11
but still exists (specifically when he talks about fonts and how they solved
that problem).
5. This does have a problem, atleast in previous version of X that there was no 
way to extend the X protocol you could only use it as is. I remember him
 specifically saying this about X10, but I don't think this extends to X11.
 Specifically  because you can create extensions that do a wide variety of things
 but there are certain parts of the design that are left closed off from extension
 like all the font handling if I remember correctly.
6. No dependence on concrete classes! That's a lot of the benefit of this design.
7. No problem with trainwrecks.
8. This is unviolated.
