CSSE120: Introduction to Software Development
An introduction to procedural and object-oriented programming with an emphasis on problem solving. Problems may include visualizing scientific or commercial data, interfacing with external hardware such as robots, or solving numeric problems from a variety of engineering disciplines. Procedural programming concepts covered include data types, variables, control structures, arrays, and data I/O. Object-oriented programming concepts covered include object creation and use, object interaction, and the design of simple classes. Software engineering concepts covered include testing, incremental development, understanding requirements, and teamwork. 

CSSE132: Introduction to Computer Systems
Provides students with an understanding of system level issues and their impact on the design and use of computer systems. Examination of both hardware and software layers. Basic computation structures and digital logic. Representation of instructions, integers, floating point numbers and other data types. System requirements, such as resource management, security, communication and synchronization, and their hardware and/or software implementation. Exploration of multiprocessor and distributed systems. Course topics will be explored using a variety of hands-on assignments and projects. 

CSSE220: Object Oriented Software Development
Object-oriented programming concepts, including the use of inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, abstract data types, and encapsulation to enable software reuse and assist in software maintenance. Recursion, GUIs and event handing. Use of common object-based data structures, including stacks, queues, lists, trees, sets, maps, and hash tables. Space/time efficiency analysis. Testing. Introduction to UML. 

CSSE230: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis
This course reinforces and extends students' understanding of current practices of producing object-oriented software. Students extend their use of a disciplined design process to include formal analysis of space/time efficiency and formal proofs of correctness. Students gain a deeper understanding of concepts from CSSE 220, including implementations of abstract data types by linear and non-linear data structures. This course introduces the use of randomized algorithms. Students design and implement software individually, in small groups, and in a challenging multi-week team project. 

CSSE232: Computer Architecture I
Computer instruction set architecture and implementation. Specific topics include historical perspectives, performance evaluation, computer organization, instruction formats, addressing modes, computer arithmetic, single-cycle and multi-cycle data paths, and processor control. Assembly language programming is used as a means of exploring instruction set architectures. The final project involves the complete design and implementation of a miniscule instruction set processor. 

CSSE304: Programming Language Concepts:
Syntax and semantics of programming languages. Grammars, parsing, data types, control flow, parameter passing, run-time storage management, binding times, functional programming and procedural abstraction, syntactic extensions, continuations, language design and evaluation. Students will explore several language features by writing an interpreter that implements them. 

CSSE332: Operating Systems:
Students learn fundamental concepts of modern operating systems by studying how and why operating systems have evolved. Topics include CPU scheduling, process synchronization, memory management, file systems, I/O systems, privacy and security, and performance evaluation. Students implement parts of an operating system as a means of exploring the details of some of these topics. 

CSSE333: Database Systems:
Relational database systems, with emphasis on entity relationship diagrams for data modeling. Properties and roles of transactions. SQL for data definition and data manipulation. Use of contemporary API's for access to the database. Enterprise examples provided from several application domains. The influence of design on the use of indexes, views, sequences, joins, and triggers. Physical level data structures: B+ trees and RAID. Survey of object databases. 

CSSE371: Software Requirements Engineering:
Basic concepts and principles of software requirements engineering, its tools and techniques, and methods for modeling software systems. Topics include requirements elicitation, prototyping, functional and non-functional requirements, object-oriented techniques, and requirements tracking. 

CSSE372: Software Project Management:
Major issues and techniques of project management. Project evaluation and selection, scope management, team building, stakeholder management, risk assessment, scheduling, quality, rework, negotiation, and conflict management. Professional issues including career planning, lifelong learning, software engineering ethics, and the licensing and certification of software professionals. 

CSSE374: Software Design:
Introduction to the architecture and design of complete software systems, building on components and patterns. Topics include architectural principles and alternatives, design documentation, and relationships between levels of abstraction. 

I'm always taking more classes but usually I only update this repo at the end of the term!
